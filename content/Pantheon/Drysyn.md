#### **Overview**

Drysyn is the god of endurance in the face of hardship, representing scarcity and the resourcefulness born from lack. They are neither cruel nor malicious; instead, they are a reminder of the value of resilience and the lessons learned when times are hard. Drysyn is venerated by the impoverished, nomads, and those who survive on the edge of society. To some, Drysyn represents hope in adversity; to others, a grim acceptance of life’s inevitable struggles.

Drysyn is said to wander the world, appearing as a weathered traveler who carries nothing but a cracked bowl and a patchwork cloak. They offer quiet guidance to those who struggle, teaching them to make do with what they have and find strength in the bare essentials.

#### **Relationships with Other Gods**

- **Opposition to Kaldyra**: While Kaldyra represents prosperity and the flow of wealth, Drysyn warns against the temptations of greed and excess, believing that struggle teaches the most enduring lessons.
- **Alliance with Thryssaeon** (God of Natural Mutation): They both represent adaptation to one’s environment, though Drysyn’s focus is survival through minimalism rather than transformation.
- **Tension with Oryndur** (God of Seriousness): Drysyn appreciates Oryndur’s discipline but rejects their rigidity, advocating for creative solutions rather than strict adherence to order.
