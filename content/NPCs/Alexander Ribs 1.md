Born into a traveling Tiefling caravan, Alexander was always peculiar, even by Tiefling standards. His crimson skin stretched unnaturally, and his body seemed to twist and bend like it had no bones. While other children played games of strength or wit, Alexander discovered that his unusual elasticity made him a natural performer.

During a fateful encounter with a wandering bard, Alexander learned to turn his physical oddities into art. Over the years, he developed a signature act where he would stretch his skin into impossible shapes and play haunting melodies on his ribcage, enchanting crowds with his strange, almost hypnotic performances.

Rumors abound that his peculiar talents stem from a fiendish pact—perhaps a forgotten ancestor's deal or even Alexander's own. Some believe his elongated form and rib-borne melodies are the result of infernal magic coursing through his veins. Whatever the truth, Alexander leans into his mysterious heritage, making his audience wonder if they’re watching a marvel of nature or a devilish trick.

Despite his eerie presence, Alexander is witty and good-natured, often breaking into cheeky jokes mid-performance. His charm makes him a favorite among circus goers and a respected (if odd) member of the troupe.
