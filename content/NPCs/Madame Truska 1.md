Madame Truska grew up in a secluded dwarven family under Tar Neôl. From a young age, Truska stood out—not for her smithing skills, but for her radiant beauty and mesmerizing hair that grew at an unnatural rate. Her family saw this as a gift from the gods, but others in the undercity whispered of witchcraft or curses.

When Truska reached adulthood, her abilities fully awakened. She discovered that her hair and beard could grow at will, moving as if alive. This revelation came during a celebration when she accidentally saved a falling child by extending her hair to catch them mid-air. The dwarves cheered, but fear lingered among the more superstitious. Soon after, her home became less welcoming, with whispers growing louder that her powers were unnatural.

Hurt but undeterred, Truska left her ancestral home to explore the wider world. She traveled across the lands, learning to master her powers and honing her skills as a performer. Her indestructible hair and its dexterity became the centerpiece of her act. She could weave elaborate tapestries mid-air, use her locks as acrobatic tools, and even sculpt her hair into lifelike forms that danced alongside her.
